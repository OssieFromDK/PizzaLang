    "About_Header": "What is Fortnite Burger?",
    "About_Sub": "Fortnite Burger is at it's core a Dead by Daylight unlocker, however Fortnite Burger has mutiple extra modules and features build on top. Fortnite Burger features a integrated mod browser, pak bypass support with auto loading SSL Bypass for steam users, custom mod support and more. The core of Fortnite Burger is an unlocker, which can unlock items, characters, cosmetics, perks and so on in-game.  The way the unlocker works is by doing a MITM attack. The image below explains what and how a MITM attack works.",
    "About_Sub2": "As seen on the image above, the original connection between your computer and Dead by Daylight servers is broken, and instead routed thru Fortnite Burger. The tool then acts as a middleman, relaying the information coming from either side to the other party, however the unlocking part is done, when the Dead by Daylight servers sends your inventory profile, then Fortnite Burger intercepts the package and replaces the inventory with one that has everything unlocked. That is how the unlocker works in basic terms.",
