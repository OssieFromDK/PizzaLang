# Fortnite Pizza Language Translations

If you want to contribute, simply download the repository, make a new file called [your language code].json and use `en.json` as the base, then you can just start translating.

## Requirements

1. You must `not` change any values that are on the left side of the semicolon (`:`)
2. You must `not` make the strings too long, as it will break the UI
3. You must `not` change capitalization of the strings you are translating
4. You must `not` change, add or remove any new things outside of the strings that you are translating
